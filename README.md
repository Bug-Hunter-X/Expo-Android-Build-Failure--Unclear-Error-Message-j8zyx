# Expo Android Build Failure: Unclear Error Message

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when building an Android app using the Expo CLI. The app functions correctly in development and on iOS, but fails to build for Android with an ambiguous error message.

## Bug Description

The Expo Android build process fails without providing a clear explanation of the underlying problem.  The app compiles and runs without issue locally and on iOS, indicating that the issue is specific to the Android build process within the Expo CLI.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Attempt to build the Android APK using `expo build:android`.
5. Observe the build failure with an unclear error message.

## Expected Behavior
A successful build and APK generation for the Android platform.

## Actual Behavior
The Expo build process fails with a vague error message, preventing APK generation. 

## Solution
This issue is solved by ensuring that all necessary dependencies are correctly installed and configured. The solution is detailed in the `expoBugSolution.js` file and involves updating the project's build configuration to address potential conflicts.
