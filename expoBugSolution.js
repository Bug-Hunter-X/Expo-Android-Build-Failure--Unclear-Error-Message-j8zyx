The error was caused by an incompatibility between a specific library version and the Expo Android build system. The solution involves updating the package.json to include a compatible version.

**Before**
```javascript
// expoBug.js
"dependencies": {
  "react": "18.2.0",
  "react-native": "0.71.8",
  "some-incompatible-package": "1.0.0"
}
```

**After**
```javascript
// expoBugSolution.js
"dependencies": {
  "react": "18.2.0",
  "react-native": "0.71.8",
  "some-incompatible-package": "2.0.0" // Updated version
}
```
After updating the package.json, run `expo install` to install the updated library. Then, try building the Android APK again using `expo build:android`. This should resolve the issue.
